# Streaming Framework

Processing data generated at high rates in real time typically faces many
challenges, from computing and networking infrastructure, to availability of
fast storage, and to user applications themselves. Streaming data directly
form the source into processing applications does not solve all issues,
but it does eliminate potential delays related to file input and output.

PvaPy Streaming Framework allows users to setup distributed streaming 
workflows with a very little effort. This documents describes various
framework components, user interfaces and available command line utilities.
